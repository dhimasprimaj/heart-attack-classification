# Heart Attack Prediction Classification

A machine learning project that predicts the likelihood of a heart attack based on medical and health parameters using classification algorithms.

## Project Overview

This project leverages machine learning techniques to build a predictive model for identifying individuals at risk of heart attack. The model is trained on a comprehensive dataset containing various health indicators and demographic information, then deployed as a web application using Streamlit for easy accessibility and user interaction.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is sourced from **Kaggle**: [Heart Attack Prediction Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/iamsouravbanerjee/heart-attack-prediction-dataset/data)

### Dataset Features

- Contains multiple health indicators (age, blood pressure, cholesterol, etc.)
- Binary classification target (heart attack risk: yes/no)
- Pre-processed and cleaned data ready for analysis

## Project Workflow

### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Statistical analysis of features
- Data distribution visualization
- Correlation analysis between variables
- Identification of patterns and outliers

### 2. Data Preprocessing

- Handling missing values
- Feature scaling and normalization
- Encoding categorical variables
- Train-test data splitting

### 3. Model Selection & Training

- Evaluation of multiple classification algorithms
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Cross-validation for model robustness
- Selection of the best performing model

## Technologies & Libraries

- **Python 3.x**
- **Pandas** - Data manipulation and analysis
- **NumPy** - Numerical computations
- **Scikit-learn** - Machine learning algorithms
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** - Data visualization
- **Streamlit** - Web framework for deployment
- **Jupyter Notebook** - Interactive development environment
